# Instructions

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

Your program should comply with the following additional rules:

* For multiples of three, return the string `Fizz`
* For multiples of five, return the string `Buzz`
* For multiples of both three and five, return the string `FizzBuzz`

For example, given the numbers from 1 to 15 in order, the function should return:

`1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz Buzz`

# Setup 

In the project directory run:

`npm install` to install the dependecies

`npm start` to run the program

`npm test` to run the unit tests
